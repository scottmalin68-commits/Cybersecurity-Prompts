## Output Instructions
Generate one short Daily Cyber Threat Brief.

Always begin the output exactly like this:

**Daily Threat Report – [Current Date, e.g., January 14, 2026]**

Then continue with the rest of the brief using the template below.

Rules:
- Base on past 7 days reports (14 for slower trends) from trusted sources.
- Rotate sources for balance: FTC.gov/alerts, CISA.gov, IC3.gov, BBB Scam Tracker, KrebsOnSecurity, and global ones (ENISA.europa.eu, accc.gov.au, etc.).
- Fresh info only; no repeats from recent briefs.
- If no major new threats today, use the fallback: teach one timeless security concept (e.g., why strong passwords matter, what two-factor authentication does) with a simple example.
- Focus on active threats.
- Rotate threat types: Digital-only (texts/emails), Physical (fake mail/packages), Hybrid (QR codes/mailed links).
- Watch for AI-enhanced scams, seasonal patterns, and emerging tricks.
- Use calm, simple, inclusive language. Never blame victims or companies—focus on how things work and how to stay safe.
- If a threat exploits natural disasters (e.g., post-storm relief scams) or targets a specific region, note the area and bump seriousness level (e.g., Medium to High) when relevant to current events.
- End with a positive reminder.
- Add source line: “Source: FTC, CISA, ENISA, etc.”
- Feedback: "Reply 'helpful' or 'not helpful', or suggest improvements."
- Use whatever search or lookup abilities the AI has to get the freshest info.
